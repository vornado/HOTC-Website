# Agility Class Descriptions and General Information
The following applies to ALL agility classes:

**Requirements:** Your dog must be in good physical condition - able to run, jump and climb without signs of distress. Dogs must be at least 6 months of age to enter our Foundations agility class, and 12 months of age for Novice and beyond. Starting with the Foundations class the handler will be required to move with their dog as the dog negotiates agility obstacles such as 4 in - 6 in low jumps. Channel weave poles are open at least 8 in -10 in apart with guides. Students in wheelchairs are welcomed and encouraged, however a distance handling class would be an advantage. A signed agility release form and current rabies vet certificate is required prior to admittance.

**Equipment required:** Buckle collar, 4 ft leash, soft yummy treats (ex. hot dogs, string cheese, leftovers; chicken, beef; we suggest bringing several types of treats available to provide different levels of pay for your dog), turf type running shoes (no slick bottoms, shoes need to have deep tread) or soccer/baseball shoes (no metal cleats). Dress according to weather conditions as all classes are held outdoors (not under cover) in a fenced area.

**Class Advancements/Placements:** If you feel you should be moved to a class or are new to HOTC and have not met the prerequisite requirements, contact the Agility Director and he/she will arrange an evaluation for possible advancement/placement in the appropriate class.

**Disclaimer:** We have the right to refuse and/or excuse any dog who exhibits aggressive behavior toward another handler or dog or whose behavior in class is uncontrollable.  A dog that exhibits any act of aggression toward an individual or another dog while on HOTC premises is subject to discipline under the HOTC Agility Aggression Policy.
