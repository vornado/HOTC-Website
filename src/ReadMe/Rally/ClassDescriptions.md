# HOTC Rally Classes
Rally is a great sport, whether you are interested in formal obedience or just want to have fun while building a stronger relationship with your dog. The instructor sets up a course consisting of signs indicating the specific skill to be performed at each. At the Novice level, these skills may include sits, downs, circles, about-turns, weaving through cones and more, all performed on leash. At more advanced levels, the skills become more difficult and the dog must learn to work off leash. Rally is a sport which is open to dogs of all breeds.
