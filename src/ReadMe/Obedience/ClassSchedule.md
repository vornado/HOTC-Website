Owners are strongly encouraged NOT to enroll multiple dogs from the same home into a single class.    In many cases, the dogs are more focused on one another than on their handlers, and may become disruptive when asked to work independently.    If this becomes a significant issue, the handlers will be asked to choose which dog should drop the class.    No refunds will be issued.

Please do NOT come to a class unless you have received an email indicating that your registration for the class has been accepted.     You will be turned away.   Everyone MUST be registered to attend classes.
