# HOTC Obedience Classes


Basic Requirements and General Information:

  -  All handlers must present documentation of age appropriate immunization for their dogs/puppies at the first class of the cycle.
  -  Handlers are asked to wear comfortable clothing and shoes with backs (ex: tennis shoes).
  -  All classes are based on a reward system, so handlers are asked to bring a variety of soft treats with which to train (ex. sliced string cheese, sliced microwaved hot dogs, soft commercial treats)
  -  Puppy and Manners 101 classes conduct orientation on the first night of the class cycle without dogs/puppies present.
  -  Some equipment is provided in the Puppy and Manners 101 classes. Additional equipment is available for purchase in our Pro Shop.
  -  All obedience classes last 50 minutes and are 8 weeks in duration.
  -  Clicker based training may be introduced and utilized in some classes.
  -  All Instructors have a wealth of knowledge in many areas of positive and reward based training,
  -  We do not train dogs. We train you to train your dogs. All classes are taught in a group setting with between 8 and 10 dogs/puppies and a ratio of one assistant per 3 dogs.
  -  All dogs/puppies must exhibit good health
  -  Our group setting is not ideal for training every dog/handler team. If you and your dog have issues that are beyond the scope of the class, we may ask that you work with private instructors outside of HOTC to resolve them prior to resuming group lessons. 

Class Prices:

  -  Puppy - $95
  -  Manners 101 - $95

Owners are strongly encouraged NOT to enroll multiple dogs from the same home into a single class. In many cases, the dogs are more focused on one another than on their handlers, and may become disruptive when asked to work independently. If this becomes a significant issue, the handlers will be asked to choose which dog should drop the class. No refunds will be issued.
