# HOTC Obedience

HOTC offers 50 minute sessions over an 8 week period of time. We do not train dogs but train you to train your dog. We boast an experienced all volunteer staff of instructors devoted to training you to train your dog.   Many of our Instructors have well over 40 years of dog training experience.  We host educational seminars throughout the year to keep everyone up to date on current training methods.

Our training is reward based.  We not only utilize clicker based training but a wealth of other positive based methods.   Classes are limited in size and we maintain a ratio of 1 assistant for every 3 students to ensure success.   We train you to train your dog no matter how big, how small or what breed.
