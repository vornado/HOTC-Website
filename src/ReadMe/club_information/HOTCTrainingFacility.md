Our facility is fully air conditioned in the summer, heated in the winter, and is completely accessible to handicapped individuals (we recently added a ramp up to the front door). Beside our fully matted training area, we have a fully stocked Pro Shop, library, kitchen, two bathrooms and a conference room.

HOTC also has a 200' x 110' fully equipped agility field next to our training building.
