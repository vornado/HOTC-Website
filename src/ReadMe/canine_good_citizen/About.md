# Canine Good Citizen

HOTC provides testing for the Canine Good Citizen (CGC) title, which is sponsored by the American Kennel Club. The tests for the CGC title show that your dog is healthy and well-kept, your dog can be examined and groomed easily by other people, accepts other people and their dogs, can walk on a leash without pulling or lunging, can sit and lie down on command, can remain in place (either sitting or laying down), can be left alone, and tolerates distracting situations. The CGC title signifies that a dog is a well mannered member of the community.
