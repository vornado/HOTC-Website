# HOTC Conformation


**CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL THE MAJORS AND CHAMPIONS.**
**OUR CLASS HAS HAD GREAT SUCCESS THIS YEAR!!!**


This is a weekly class. Both members and non-members are welcome. Non-members must call or email me prior to attending the first class session.

Please check this website weekly to see if class will be held on Sunday. Specific instructions and information will be updated weekly on this page. This class will be held for one hour. If no students have arrived to attend the class during the first 15 minutes, then class will be cancelled.

The cost of this class for non-members is $10 for the handler with one dog and $5 for each additional dog with the same handler. Non-members - please try to be there at least five minutes before the hour starts so I can get your paperwork/fees. For non-members who have not yet attended, please bring your dog's shot records (including the rabies verification). You must sign a liability release form at the first class.

Please call me at 256-541-5592 or email me at andreacobb141@gmail.com if you have any questions.

Katrina Groutage will be co-teaching.

Thanks,
Andi Cobb

P.S. If there is space in the classes/room (highly probable), anyone can bring pups into the class for socialization, but you must call or email me to let me know you are coming for socialization.
